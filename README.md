World Store Data Analytics – SQL Project 
The World Store Data Analytics project focuses on analyzing large-scale retail data from a global chain of stores using SQL. The dataset includes multiple interconnected tables such as customers, products, categories, orders, order_items, stores, employees, inventory, and suppliers. The goal of the project is to use SQL to perform data exploration, cleaning, transformation, and analytical reporting to understand business performance across different countries and regions.

Using SQL queries, the project uncovers key business insights such as:

Top-performing products and categories based on revenue and quantity sold

Store-wise and region-wise sales performance

Customer segmentation based on frequency, spending habits, and geographic distribution

Inventory analysis, including stock levels, replenishment needs, and fast/slow-moving products

Sales trends over time, including seasonal peaks and growth patterns
